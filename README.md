Once you have the Telegram user ID, you can use this as the basis for generating a unique identifier specific to your bot. This identifier can be a combination of the user's Telegram ID and some additional data or a hash to ensure uniqueness.
Storing the Unique Identifier:

Store the generated unique identifier in your bot's database or a data store. This allows you to associate this identifier with the specific Telegram user.
Checking for Uniqueness:

Whenever a user interacts with your bot, you can check their Telegram user ID against the stored unique identifiers in your database. If the Telegram user ID already exists, it means the user has interacted with your bot before and can be identified as a returning user. If it doesn't exist, it's a new user.
